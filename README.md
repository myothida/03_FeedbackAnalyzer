# Feedback Analyzer using Python and Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python-based feedback analyzer that uses machine learning techniques to process and classify feedback into various sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, and neutral. The project is still in-progress, with ongoing exploration of different machine learning and deep learning models to enhance the accuracy and capabilities of the feedback analyzer.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Currently experimenting with models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and deep learning architectures.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Performs tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for clean and structured input.
- **Evaluation**: The project is continuously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **API Access**: The feedback analyzer is accessible through a publicly available API, allowing users to interact with the model directly.

## API Access

The feedback analyzer API is currently accessible at the following URL:

[Feedback Analyzer API](https://mmdt.istarvz.com/our_playground/)

You can use this API to send feedback comments and receive sentiment predictions. The API is still under active development, and additional features and improvements are expected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`, `seaborn`, `flask` (for API)

## In-progess
This project is actively being developed, with ongoing research to explore and integrate different machine learning and deep learning models. Current explorations include:

Experimenting with various algorithms to improve accuracy.
Evaluating deep learning techniques such as LSTM, BERT, and Transformers.
Enhancing preprocessing techniques and expanding the dataset for better training.
